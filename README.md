# A List of Papers on LLM Inference Optimization

This repository collects papers on two main topics:
1. **Secure Inference via TEE-Shielded DNN Partitioning**: Explores methods that partition a Deep Neural Network (DNN) between a resource-constrained secure environment (like a TEE) and a powerful untrusted host (like a GPU). The core idea is to offload the bulk of computation to the GPU while executing only a small, critical portion of the model within the TEE. 
2.  **Efficient Inference for Large Language Models**: Focuses on techniques to optimize the performance (latency, throughput, memory) of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various hardware.
